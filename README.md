# Crewstand Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)-based application for controlling and monitoring industrial actuators, including solenoid valves, proportional valves, and pumps. The application utilizes [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for its user interface and API client generated by [OpenAPI-TS](https://heyapi.dev/).

## Features

* Real-time monitoring and control of actuators
* Support for multiple types of actuators (solenoid valves, proportional valves, and pumps)
* User-friendly interface with interactive sliders and switches
* API client generated using [OpenAPI-TS](https://heyapi.dev/) for seamless integration with the backend API

## Getting Started

### Installation
The project is configured to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it using npm:
```
corepack enable pnpm
```

To set up the project, run the following command:
```
pnpm install
```
### Development

To start the development server, run:
```
pnpm dev
```
This will start the Next.js development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building and Deployment

To build the application, run:
```
pnpm build
```
This will create a production-ready build of the application.

## Configuration

The application uses the following configuration files:

* `next.config.js`: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) configuration file
* `openapi-ts.config.ts`: [OpenAPI-TS](https://heyapi.dev/) configuration file
* `package.json`: npm package file

### Environment Variables
The application uses the following environment variables:
| Variable        | Description                                |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| BACKEND_URI     | The URI of the backend API                 |

#### Details
- **BACKEND_URI**: This variable specifies the URI of the backend API endpoint that the server-side code will interact with. It is generally safe to use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` if your backend is running on the same server where the Next.js application is deployed.

## API Client

The API client is generated using [OpenAPI-TS](https://heyapi.dev/) and is located in the `app/api` directory. To generate the API client, run the following command:
```
pnpm generate-client
```

## Docker Support

The application includes a `Dockerfile` that allows you to containerize the application for easy deployment.
